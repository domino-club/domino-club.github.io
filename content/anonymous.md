# ANONYMOUS MESSAGING
{{< anonymous-messaging >}}

## READ BEFORE USING THIS
This is **not** for jokes, misdirection, or any other ironic usage. If use this system in bad faith, you will make your friends uncomfortable.

This will post a message to the **#domino-anonymous** channel on the domino club discord. Tagging users and channels doesn't work. Custom emoji won't show.

You can non-anonymously contact **candle** or **Emma** privately if you feel your sensitive issue can't be raised using this system.
